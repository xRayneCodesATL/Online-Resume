<h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Thank you for taking time to look at my resume. I would like to give you a brief introduction to myself and what I'm hoping to achieve.</p>
<p>My name is Rayne, I'm 34 years old. My pronouns are they/them. I'm originally from Albertville, AL. I reside in Atlanta, GA with my beautiful fiance, Gemma, and our two cats, Stinky (I know, I know) and Toby. They're 4 years old and absolutely rotten, but I love them dearly and wouldn't trade them for the world.</p>
<p>This past year I have buckled down and realized that I really wanted to make a solid career path for myself. Though, I am new to developing, I have years of computer skills under my belt. I am a very fast learner and I am always looking to attain new skills. I take pride in my strong drive and self-motivation. I am so excited about new journey in Web Development.</p>
